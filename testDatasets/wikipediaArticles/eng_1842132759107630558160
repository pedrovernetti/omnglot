# Reception 

Writing for The New York Times, Parul Sehgal considered Ghachar Ghochar to be "a great Indian novel" and wrote, "Folded into the compressed, densely psychological portrait of [the narrator's] family is a whole universe: a parable of rising India, an indictment of domestic violence, a taxonomy of ants and a sly commentary on translation itself." Deborah Smith of The Guardian reviewed that the book was "both fascinatingly different from much Indian writing in English, and provides a masterclass in crafting, particularly on the power of leaving things unsaid.Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times labelled Ghachar Ghochar as "one of the finest literary works you will ever encounter"; she drew comparisons to the works of R. K. Narayan, Anton Chekhov and Machado de Assis and found the unnamed narrator to be reminiscent of the protagonist in Ivan Goncharov’s Russian novel Oblomov. Lucy Scholes of The Independent too took note of the comparisons to Chekhov and wrote that "brevity serves Shanbhag’s storytelling to great effect, not least because much of what makes the narrative so gripping lies in what he leaves unsaid." Reviewing the book for The Globe and Mail, Jade Colbert found the unnamed narrator to be "a superfluous man of the type Chekhov might recognize" and commended Shanbhag for subtlety conveying the troubled "gender dynamic" in India.Preti Taneja of the New Statesman took note of the book's feminist themes and wrote, "Perur’s translation captures the heartbreaking achievement of Shanbhag’s writing: to present, in a line or two, a body and mind coming of age in a society that casts violence as tenderness, ownership as love." Writing for Hindustan Times, Prajwal Parajuly praised Shanbhag for finding emotional depth in his sparse prose.The New York Times included Ghachar Ghochar in their literary critics' listing of the best books of 2017. The book was longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2017 and was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 2018.
