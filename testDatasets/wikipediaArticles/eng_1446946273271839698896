## Join the Flumeride

Join the Flumeride is a 1998 Swedish mockumentary. The plot revolves around two fictional bands, "Gula Tidningen" and "Pincette", which are parodies of Swedish pop groups Gyllene Tider and Roxette respectively. The film features a cameo by Per Gessle, the lead vocalist of Gyllene Tider and one half of the duo Roxette. The title is a takeoff on the lyrics of Roxette's hit 1991 single, Joyride.
