## Robert Bentley Suthers

Robert Bentley Suthers was born in Manchester in Lancashire, England in 1871. Very little is known about his personal life besides that which can be inferred from the 1911 UK census and the military records of his son, Robert Eric Suthers. Robert married a woman named Alice and fathered a son, Robert Eric Suthers. R. E. Suthers was killed in the First Battle of the Aisne during the First World War on 2 August 1918. He was nineteen. After his son's death, Robert Bentley Suthers became a writer for The Clarion, a socialist newspaper. He published the majority of his work through The Clarion and engaged in a long philosophical debate regarding the nature of free will with G.K Chesterton. This debate would be referenced in Chesterton's book Orthodoxy.
