# Background 

The Philippine festival referred to in Rosca's State of War have similarities with the yearly "Mardi Gras" held on Panay Island. However, the festival was used by Rosca as a literary instrument to present the "revolutionary theme" of the novel.Rosca's State of War was also a narrative description of the effects of colonialism to the Filipinos' national identity. State of war shows women continuing their struggle in years of colonization against generations of, " rape, violence, and oppresion." State of War is written with nostalgia for the pre-contact days of a strong female presence in Filipino society. Other reviews also reveal that Rosca uses an, "intricate interplay of discourses on sexuality and (post)colonialism."It also traced the ancestry of the principal characters during Spanish and American colonialism in the Philippines. The personal memories of the main characters was a recollection of a "state of war" in the Philippines during Marcos's regime that failed to become a true revolution.
