Much of what we know of Reddy's early life draws from an autobiography that he published in 1993, titled The Revolutions I Have Lived Through.Reddy was born on 23 January 1910 in the then-princely state of Hyderabad, in the village of Waddepally. His grandfather, Narasimha Reddy, had three sons: Jaganmohan Redd'ys father, Venkataramareddy, as well as Krishna Reddy and Ranga Reddy. Jaganmohan Reddy's father was adopted by his paternal uncle to be the heir, as his paternal uncle Ramachandra Reddy's only son died at the age of eleven. Reddy's adoptive and natural grandfathers both died young, leaving his father, Venkataramareddy to support his family at the age of fifteen. His father took pp the position of collecting tax revenues for the Nalgonda District, and married his mother in 1898: they were aged 16 and 13 respectively at the time of marriage. Reddy's father was mostly self-educated, and according to Reddy, placed great value on education, establishing the Reddy Boarding Girls' Hostel and Girls School in Hyderabad, as well as supporting the education of several female children in the extended family.Reddy had five siblings, all born before him: his elder sister, Kamala, and his brother Manmohan Reddy both died in childhood. His surviving siblings included a sister, Kumudini, and two brothers, Janardhan, and Madhusudan. He spent his early childhood in Wadepally, while his siblings were being educated in Hyderabad. In addition to his contracts with the colonial government for the collection of various taxes, including excise tax, Reddy's father supported his family through a number of business interests based in Hyderabad, including cotton and ginning factories, and shell petrol and oil agencies.Reddy married his wife, Sita, in 1935; he was 25 years old, and she was 16.
