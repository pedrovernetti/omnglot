# History 

The Monastery of San Francisco was one of the works of Nicolás de Ovando. Construction began with the arrival of the Franciscan fathers around 1509. It was the first monastery in the New World. The monastery was later hit by a hurricane. Construction began on the main part of the church in 1544 and was completed on July 23, 1556. In 1586 it was sacked by Francis Drake. Repairs were completed in 1664, but according to historians, the building was damaged by earthquakes in 1673 and 1751.Alonso de Ojeda was buried at the main entrance to the monastery. His remains were moved to the former Convento Dominico on October 12, 1942. Also found were the remains of Bartholomew Columbus. During the Battle of Palo Hincado (1808) against the French, a piece of artillery was deployed on the roof. The vault was cut, and a timber platform was constructed.The building was used as a mental asylum from the 1880s until the 1930s. A hurricane at that time caused a lot of damage, which was never repaired. Currently, the ruins are used for social and cultural events and are cared for and protected by law and by the county of Efemérides.
