# Gameplay 

Dynasty Warriors 7 is the first game in the series to extend past the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. Consequently, the Jin Kingdom was added, bringing the total number of major factions to four.

This game's Musou mode is not character based but kingdom based.
The Renbu combat system has been removed, replaced by the return to the familiar charge system, which allows players to end increasingly longer combos with a charge attack of varying effect depending on the current situation. Characters are also allowed to wield more than one weapon during battle, with the ability to execute a special attack upon switching. In addition, both aerial musou attacks (depending on the character) and certain aerial combos have been introduced. Players will still be able to adjust the camera angle.
Character and weapon level development/customisation can now be done during battle. Players can also choose to switch their equipped weapons during battle and can obtain new weapons by defeating officers.
Characters have a special attack with a weapon indicated with an EX icon. The EX attack uses a sequence of attacks and/or charge attacks, and the result will vary with most characters. Characters also have 2 musou attacks that they perform using their Ex Weapon which can consist of grapples, midair, charges, quick/heavy strikes or a combo of hits performed in certain ways.
An additional mode known as Conquest Mode (Chronicle Mode for the Japanese version) has been incorporated into the game. Gameplay features include a player-forged path through China in which the player can also choose to play "Other" characters in the kingdom, due to the fact that they have not been given their own story in Story Mode. Conquest Mode will also feature both online and offline co-operative play. This mode also replaces the old Free Mode present in previous titles.
The morale bar has been removed from the visual interface; however, the morale system itself still remains and will be reflected from the messages of officers and their respective facial expressions (neutral, happy, sad, angry etc.) when said message appears.
Some of the major battles are split into two parts, so the player can have a different perspectives of the battle. One example would be in Shu's Changban stage — the first part concentrating on Zhao Yun and the second part on Zhang Fei.
Swimming and climbing ladders from the previous Dynasty Warriors 6 are once again present.
The Weapon system has been changed dramatically from previous titles and players can now choose up to 10 or 11 weapons from each weapon category, unique Weapons are once again available after being cut from Dynasty Warriors 6
Support animals which aid players in battle are included in this installment — some will follow and battle with the player; some can be ridden. Available animals are horses, bears, pandas, elephants, wolves, tigers and falcons.
Downloadable Content will be available. Content will include stages, music and costumes from previous games and some original costumes plus new weapons and the option to use the original Japanese Voices.
