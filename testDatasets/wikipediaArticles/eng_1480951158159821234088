## Clayton, Staffordshire

Clayton is a suburb and a ward in the south of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.

# Today 

Clayton lies on the boundary between urban and rural Staffordshire, not far from Newcastle's border with the Borough of Stafford. The older part of the village stands on top of a hill, Northwood Lane, and some of these older houses were once gardeners' cottages on the Staffordshire estates of the Duke of Sutherland, who owned the Trentham Estate.
Towards Trent Vale is the Clayton Wood Training Ground and the football academy of Stoke City F.C.

# Education 

Clayton has one secondary school, Clayton Hall Academy. It has been developed on the site of the 19th century Clayton Hall and has around 1000 pupils from all over Newcastle-under-Lyme. Until 2005 it was named Clayton High School. Then the school became a specialist school in Business & Enterprise and Modern Languages and was renamed Clayton Hall Business and Language College. The school converted to academy status in 2015 and was renamed again to Clayton Hall Academy.

# Religion 

The Catholic Church in Clayton is Our Lady and St Werburgh 
which has over 500 regular worshippers and the primary school judged by Ofsted as 'outstanding' in every category. The parish runs three youth groups, an over 55s group, a parents and toddlers group, various parish house groups as well as running LinkLine. LinkLine is a charity that rings up housebound elderly people for a regular weekly chat to show that they are loved and offer help in various ways.
There is also, based in the Parish Hall, one of the longest running Before and After School Clubs in the area, Wise Owls Care Club which provides Before and After School Care and a Holiday Scheme for the children who attend the school.

Within Clayton is St James Church which has a blue/green roof - originally copper, over the years with weather conditions has become this natural colour. This is an Anglican church where there is a Sunday School for children of any age. The school is held in the church hall at the same time as the main service is taken.

Another nearby church is Newcastle Baptist Church (NBC). Rainbows, Brownies and Guides (Girlguiding) are held in the onsite community hall and Beavers, Cubs and Scouts are held in the den along with Explorers. These are held on a week night and there are two scout groups to go to; on Monday the Spitfires and Wednesday the Harriers. They were named after planes and are used to tell the two groups apart as they are both called 79th NBC Scouts. In Explorers the Duke of Edinburgh award can be taken. The site where the church is situated used to be part of the United Reformed Church before it changed to NBC in 2012. Since then, extensive work has been undertaken to create a new entrance and a community building at the rear of the site.
