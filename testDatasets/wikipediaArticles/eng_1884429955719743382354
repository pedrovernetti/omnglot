## MétéoMédia

MétéoMédia is a Canadian French-language weather information specialty channel and web site owned by Pelmorex. MétéoMédia primarily serves viewers in Quebec, although some cable TV systems in Ontario and New Brunswick carry the channel as well. It is available nationwide via satellite. MétéoMédia went on the air along with the bilingual specialty service's English-language component, The Weather Network, for the first time on September 1, 1988; both MétéoMédia and The Weather Network broadcast separate 24-hour-a-day feeds.
MétéoMedia has a separate feed for the Montreal area.

# Ownership 

Both MétéoMedia and the Weather Network are owned by Pelmorex. The two originally shared an analogue transponder on one of the Anik satellites, with computer-generated local forecasts airing on one while the video feed of a live forecaster or TV commercials aired on the other. They swapped these two roles every five minutes.
On January 3, 2008, it was reported that Landmark Communications, part-owner of MétéoMédia, may be for sale. In July 2008, the Weather Channel was sold to NBCUniversal and Bain Capital; the sale includes Landmark's stakes in MétéoMedia and the Weather Network. Comcast, the parent of NBCUniversal, subsequently sold this minority interest to Pelmorex in 2015.
