## Swapan Kumar Datta

Swapan Kumar Datta (born 28 January 1953) is a well known scientist (Professor) of rice biotechnology. He is well known for his pioneering research on genetic engineering of Indica rice. Dr. Datta has demonstrated the development of genetically engineered Indica rice from protoplast derived from haploid embryogenic cell suspension culture. Golden Indica Rice with enriched Provitamin A and Ferritin rice with high iron content were developed by his group with a vision to meet the challenges of malnutrition in developing countries. Prof. Swapan Datta has been named as one among the top 25 Indian scientists from all fields of science by India Today.Currently, Prof. Datta is working as Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Visva-Bharati University (a Central University founded by the great Rabindranath Tagore), Santiniketan, West Bengal, India. Before taking the present responsibility from 31.01.2015, he was positioned as Deputy Director General (DDG-Crop Science) in Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi. He is also currently holding the position Sir Rash Behari Ghosh Chair Professor (on lien) at Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.

# Early life and education 

Prof. Swapan Datta received his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) degree in Botany (Honours) in 1972 from Presidency College (presently Presidency University), Calcutta. He completed Master of Science (M.Sc) in Botany from University of Calcutta in the year 1974. From the same university, he obtained PhD degree in 1980. He also completed a course on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) from Cornell University, USA in 2003.

# Career 

At the early stage, Swapan Kumar Datta was associated as a Lecturer in Botany with Ramkrishna Mission, Vivekanada Centenary College, West Bengal, India from 1976 to 1979. Then he joined Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, West Bengal as a lecturer and became Reader in Botany in 1985 and served there up to 1989. During the time, he moved to Germany with the prestigious DAAD fellowship and worked with Prof. G. Wenzel. He then took up an assignment as senior scientist at Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland. In 1987, he became group leader and senior scientist at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Dr. Datta worked over there on rice genetic engineering for six years and was associated with Prof. Ingo Potrykus. Meanwhile, he spent six months as visiting Associate Professor at University of California, Davis, USA. For a short span of time in 1993, he joined as staff research scientist at International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi. Dr. Swapan Datta moved to join International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, Philippines as Senior Plant Biotechnologist in 1993. During IRRI tenure, he became the HarvestPlus Rice crop Leader. He returned to India in 2005 to join as Sir Rash Behari Ghosh Chair Professor at University of Calcutta. He established Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Laboratory and became the coordinator of Translational Rice Research Programme funded by DBT, Govt. of India. In 2009, he was appointed as DDG (Crop Science), ICAR, the apex body of India for coordinating, guiding and managing research and education in agriculture and served there up to 30.01.2015. From 31 January 2015, he is serving as Pro-Vice Chancellor (SAHA UPACHARYA) in the Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, West Bengal.
