The Balcony is a 1963 film adaptation of Jean Genet's play The Balcony, directed by Joseph Strick. It starred Shelley Winters, Peter Falk, Lee Grant and Leonard Nimoy. George J.

The film also credits the photographer Helen Levitt as an assistant director, and Verna Fields, who subsequently won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, as the sound editor.

# Plot 

Shelley Winters plays the madam of a brothel where customers play out their erotic fantasies, oblivious to a revolution which is sweeping the country. When her old friend the chief of police (Peter Falk) asks her to impersonate the missing queen in order to reassure the people and halt the revolution, she offers instead three of her customers to play the general, bishop and chief justice, all of whom have died in the revolution.

# Reception 

Shortly after its release, the film was negatively reviewed by The New York Times' critic Bosley Crowther, but favorably reviewed in Variety: "With Jean Genet's apparent approval, Joe Strick and Ben Maddow have eliminated the play's obscene language (though it's still plenty rough) and clarified some of its obscurations. The result is a tough, vivid and dispassionate fantasy." Following the release of the DVD in 2000, Karl Wareham also reviewed it favorably: "'The Balcony' is recommended for those who like an enigma of a film, one that tugs at your subconscious long after the titles fade. Itâ€™s a film that reaches to the very heart of why our society works in the way it does, and presents unrelenting questions and dilemmas."

# Preservation 

The Academy Film Archive preserved The Balcony in 2010.
