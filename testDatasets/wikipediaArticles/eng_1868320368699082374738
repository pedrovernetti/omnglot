## Vehicle registration plates of Oregon

The U.S. state of Oregon first required its residents to register their motor vehicles in 1905. Registrants provided their own license plates for display until 1911, when the state began to issue plates.Plates are currently provided by the Driver & Motor Vehicle Services branch of the Oregon Department of Transportation. Front and rear plates are required on all vehicles except for motorcycles.

# 1911 to 1949 

No slogans were used on passenger plates during the period covered by this subsection.

# 1950 to present 

In 1956, the United States, Canada, and Mexico came to an agreement with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the Automobile Manufacturers Association and the National Safety Council that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for motorcycles) at 6 inches (15 cm) in height by 12 inches (30 cm) in width, with standardized mounting holes. The 1955 (dated 1956) issue was the first Oregon license plate that complied with these standards.
All plates from 1955 until present are still valid, provided they are displayed on the vehicle to which they were originally issued.

# Optional plates 

There are also special plates available for special interest vehicles, antique vehicles, veterans, and various service clubs.

# Non-passenger plates
