## ELMO2

Engulfment and cell motility protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ELMO2 gene.The protein encoded by this gene interacts with the dedicator of cyto-kinesis 1 protein. Similarity to a C. elegans protein suggests that this protein may function in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and in cell migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
