# History 

# Capital island dispute 

On 26 October 2009, the government decided to move the capital of Shaviyani Atoll from Funadhoo to Milandhoo, citing more ease for the people. However, this decision was overruled by parliament in June 2010, and Funadhoo was reinstated as the capital of the atoll, much to the dismay of both the government and the people of Milandhoo. This decision was vetoed by President Nasheed, and Milandhoo continued as the seat of the atoll office. The issue surfaced once again on February 26, 2011 when home rule was introduced into the country and the atoll offices were to be rebranded as the secretariats for the newly formed atoll councils. According to the Decentralization Bill, under which the councils were formed, the respective secretariats were to be seated in the capital islands of each atoll as stipulated in the new constitution of 2008, which in Shaviyani Atoll's case is Funadhoo. In the first atoll council meeting, it was decided to move the secretariat from Milandhoo to Funadhoo, as per the law states. The government responded with threats to dissolve the council if the move is followed through, and appealed the order of the Funadhoo Magistrate Court to carry out the move. On March 1, after the Milandhoo Magistrate Court ordered the work of the secretariat to return to Milandhoo, an order backed by the President, riot police was deployed to Funadhoo to "urge the council to respect the court order" issued by Milandhoo. The following day, the Supreme Court of the Maldives ruled that the Milandhoo court order was invalid and that the Funadhoo court order was, a ruling which the government and Milandhoo did not accept. On April 6, the parliament overrode the initial presidential veto on the capital island legislature, and declared Funadhoo as the legitimate capital island. In 2012, all of the materials used in Milandhoo were transferred to Funadhoo.
It is notable that as of 2013, the official website of the President's Office does not display an address for the Shaviyani Atoll Council.
