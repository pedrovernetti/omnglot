## Cinema (Elaine Paige album)

Cinema is the fourth solo album by Elaine Paige. The album was released in 1984 on Warner Music, peaking at #12 in the UK album charts. It has been re-issued on CD.

# Background 

For Stages (1983), Paige had chosen tracks from musical theatre. Following this theme, this album featured songs that had been previously recorded for soundtracks.
Tim Rice wrote lyrics to Vangelis's theme for the film Missing specifically for this album.

# Production 

Cinema was the second of Paige's recordings to be produced by Tony Visconti.
Like Stages, the recording was primarily conducted at Visconti's Good Earth Studios, other than for "Sometimes" (Theme from Champions) which had been previously recorded at CTS Studios, London featuring the New World Philharmonia.

# Out-Takes 

In 2014, Rhino UK released on the compilation album Elaine Paige - The Ultimate Collection the out-take "What A Feeling" (from the musical 'Flashdance') which was originally recorded as part of the 'Cinema' album sessions.
