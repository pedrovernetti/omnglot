## Lycopolis (Delta)

Lycopolis or Lykopolis (Greek: Λυκούπολις, Strabo xvii. p. 802; Steph. B. s. v.), or the Deltaic Lycopolis was an ancient town in the Sebennytic nome in Lower Egypt, in the neighbourhood of Mendes, and, from its appellation, apparently founded by a colony of Osirian priests from the town of Lycopolis in Upper Egypt. The Deltaic Lycopolis was the birthplace of the Neo-Platonic philosopher Plotinus in 204. (Suidas, p. 3015.)
