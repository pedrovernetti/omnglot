## China Railway DF4

The DF4 (Chinese: 东风4) is a type of diesel-electric locomotive used in the People's Republic of China. It has been in production since 1969 and is still produced as of 2007 by several local companies. It is the most common locomotive in China and is used for both passenger and freight services.

# Models 

# DF4 

The first DF4 was built in 1969 in Dalian. The first 108 locomotives that were built here are the original DF4s using the 16V240ZJ engine. It took seven years to build all 108 locomotives of this type. Due to unstable technique in the production of early-built DF4 locomotives, malfunctions of mechanic and electric parts occurred frequently during the operation, especially the diesel engine. Thus, most DF4 locomotives were taken out of service for maintenance, and railroad engineers from Fengtai Locomotive Depot sarcastically joked that the DF4 "can't make it from Dongdan to Xisi". Therefore, Dalian Locomotive Works introduced 16V240ZJA, an improved diesel engine. They are nicknamed "Watermelon".
Few of the first series DF4 are still in operation, however the first ever is a permanent exhibition at the Beijing Railway Museum.

# DF4A 

The DF4A distinguishes itself from first series DF4s with an improved engine, the 16V240ZJA. Production started in 1976 (the first model being DF4-0109) and lasted until 1984. The DF4A designation is unofficial.

# DF4B 

Nicknamed Watermelon, Military Police, or Orange. General speaking, Watermelons and Militarys are used for freight, while Oranges are almost used for passenger services. DF4B are very similar to standard DF4, apart from an improved engine (16V240ZJB). Production started in Dalian in 1984.

# DF4C 

The DF4C was supposed to replace the DF4B as the main diesel locomotive in China and comes with several improvements, including a new engine revision (16240ZJC). The first DF4C was produced in 1985 and batch production started four years later, in 1989, and lasted until roughly the end of the 20th century.
The DF4C comes in a different color scheme than the previous DF4s, namely dark blue and later light blue and beige. The passenger version, informally called DF4CK, has an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement.

# Gearing variations 

The DF4, DF4B and DF4C were each produced with two different gear ratios, "passenger" (up to 120 km/h or 75 mph or 170 km/h or 110 mph for DF4C) and "freight" (up to 100 km/h or 62 mph). The passenger variant was often painted orange.

# DF4D 

The DF4D, the most recent DF4 revision, has been produced since 1996 with the 16V240ZJD engine. The passenger versions increased top speed to 145 km/h (90 mph) or 170 km/h (110 mph). The freight version comes in a different color scheme than the previous DF4Ds, namely green(7000 Series) and later light blue(4000 Series) and yellow. The green version sat on radial bogies but later converted to standard bogies. Their top speed to 100 km/h (62 mph).

# DF4DJ 

The DF4DJ, originally DF4DAC, of which only 2 were built had AC drive technology supplied by Siemens. They were China's first AC drive diesel locomotive.

# DF4DD 

A road-switcher version of the DF4 with side walkways and a full-body cab similar to modern American locomotives. It was 
the most powerful road switcher class in China until the introduction of the HXN3B and HXN5B classes.

# DF4E 

The DF4E is a 2 unit locomotive of total power 4.86MW (2x2.43MW)

# Manufacturers 

DF4s have been manufactured by several companies:

CSR Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Co., Ltd.
CSR Ziyang Locomotive Works (DF4B, DF4C & DF4C(A1A))
Dalian Locomotive & Rolling Stock Works
Datong locomotive factory

# North Korea 

In 2001, the Korean State Railway bought two locomotives of type CKD4A (DF4D) new from CNR Dalian; these were delivered in July 2002. These are powered by the same 16V240ZJD as the Chinese DF4D, producing 2,940 kW (3,940 hp) and have a maximum speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). They are painted in the standard light blue over dark green, but their numbers are not known.
Between 2006 and 2008, three batches of refurbished second-hand DF4 ("DF4A") and DF4B were delivered to North Korea. These are numbered in the 내연200 series (내연 = Naeyŏn, "internal combustion") and are in service for passenger and freight trains all over North Korea; many are assigned to the Hamhŭng area. The total number delivered is not known, but the number is at least 36 units, numbered 내연201 to 내연225 and 내연261 to 내연271. Many are still in their former Chinese paint, but some have been repainted into the standard light blue over dark green, and two have received the dark green/yellow scheme applied to many M62-type diesels obtained second hand from Germany and Slovakia. There is at least one DF4D, in standard blue over green livery.
