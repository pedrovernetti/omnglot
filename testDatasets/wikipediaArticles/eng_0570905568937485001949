## Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)

Out of Order is the fifteenth studio album by Rod Stewart, released in 1988. It features the hit singles "Lost in You", "Forever Young", "My Heart Can't Tell You No", and "Crazy About Her". The album was produced by Stewart and members of The Power Station: guitarist Andy Taylor (also a former member of Duran Duran), and bassist Bernard Edwards (formerly of Chic). Chic drummer Tony Thompson also plays on the record.

# Critical reception 

The album was considered by many critics a return to form after a series of less successful albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it "well-constructed", and Rolling Stone magazine called it a "confident, well-written, high-voltage work". Robert Christgau, however, gave it a C, unfavorably comparing the album to the work of The Power Station.

# Commercial performance 

The album reached #20 on the Billboard 200, eventually going 2x Platinum, which made it Stewart's best-selling album of the 1980s.
Each single released from the album went to the Top 20 of either the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, or the Billboard Hot 100. Music videos were also produced and released for each. The most successful single was "My Heart Can't Tell You No", which reached the Top 5 of both the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Billboard Hot 100. The album had four charting hits in the U.S., the biggest being "My Heart Can't Tell You No" at #4.
In January 1989, immediately following Super Bowl XXIII, NBC Sports used "Forever Young" as the soundtrack for a year-in-review segment showcasing highlights from the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 1988 World Series, the 1989 Fiesta Bowl, and Super Bowl XXIII. All four events had been broadcast by NBC.
The structure of the lyrics to "Forever Young" are very similar to a Bob Dylan song of the same title. When this was realized, the song was then sent to Dylan, out of respect, asking whether he had a problem with it. Stewart and Dylan agreed to participate in the ownership of the song and share Stewart's royalties. 
In Brazil, the album was certified Gold in 1994.
