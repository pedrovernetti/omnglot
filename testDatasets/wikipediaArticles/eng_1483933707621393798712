## Thrilling Adventure Hour

The Thrilling Adventure Hour was a staged production and podcast in the style of old time radio that was held monthly at Largo, a Los Angeles nightclub located in the former Coronet Theatre. The show ran from March 2005 to April 2015. Each episode featured three non-serialized segments as well as songs and commercials from fictional sponsors. The show was written by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker; and directed by Aaron Ginsburg. The show's original songs were written by Acker & Blacker with the composer and band leader Andy Paley.

# History 

The roots of the Thrilling Adventure Hour began in Blacker's living room where he and Acker held a reading of their film script for a space western called Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars. Struck by the quality of the performances, they decided to launch a stage show with a radio conceit, so that the performers had the luxury of holding scripts in their hands and minimal blocking. The conceit allowed Acker and Blacker to not impose too greatly on their actor friends, while maintaining a regular deadline for generating material, honing their craft and workshopping content in front of an audience.The Thrilling Adventure and Supernatural Suspense Hour began a five-year run at M Bar in Hollywood in March 2005. The original WorkJuice Players were Dave 'Gruber' Allen, Paget Brewster, Craig Cackowski, Mark Gagliardi, Marc Evan Jackson, Hal Lublin, Annie Savage and Paul F. Tompkins. In episode six, Eban Schletter performed live musical accompaniment. Schletter wrote the theme song to "Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars". In episode seven, the show was joined by Andy Paley. Acker & Blacker and Paley created musical content for the show. Paley arranged Schletter's Sparks Nevada theme and performed themes and songs with his Andy Paley Orchestra, which, at the time, consisted of Jillinda Palmer, Ben Jaffe, and Brittney Westover.
In episode eight, the show was joined by Joel Spence, a Foley artist and actor. Soon thereafter, Aaron Ginsburg joined as director. Shortly after that, Samm Levine, Danny Strong, and John DiMaggio joined the cast. Then James Urbaniak, John Ennis and Autumn Reeser. The band Common Rotation made a guest appearance on the show and played afterwards. Common Rotation became a regular staple following the Thrilling Adventure Hour. Marc Evan Jackson hosted Common Rotation's segment, which featured songs performed by Common Rotation as well as WorkJuice players and guest stars.
The final performance of The Thrilling Adventure and Supernatural Suspense Hour at M Bar was in January 2010. In March 2010, The Thrilling Adventure Hour shortened its title and started its run at Largo at the Coronet where it continued. Beginning in January 2011, the Thrilling Adventure Hour began podcasting sketches from past performances. In January 2011, the cast took the show on the road for the first time and performed two shows at SF Sketchfest. In October 2011, the Thrilling Adventure Hour podcast joined the network of podcasts released by Chris Hardwick's Nerdist Industries.
At SDCC 2014, Thrilling Adventure Hour performed a live crossover show with the cast of Welcome to Night Vale titled "Thrilling Adventure Hour & Welcome to Night Vale Crossover", which was released for sale on Night Vale's Bandcamp and the iTunes music store on October 1, 2014.In 2015, it was announced that after 10 years of live monthly Thrilling Adventure Hour stage performances, the last such performance would be April 11, 2015. Also announced, was that there will be two new monthly comics in the Sparks Nevada and Beyond Belief storylines, starting February 2015. The podcast will continue in the form of audio versions of the comic books.
The Thrilling Adventure Hour returned for new episodes in October 2018.

# The Chronopatrol Universe 

While not an official title, the Chronopatrol Universe is a convenient way to refer to several mid-show segments that share characters and themes.

"Jefferson Reid, Ace American" – A clandestine war is being waged against the Reich, and at the frontlines of this sometimes mystical, often monstrous battle, is Jefferson Reid, America's only super-soldier. Aided by his super-sweetheart, Agent Abby Adams (who hates nothing as much as she hates a dirty Kraut), and his plucky sidekick, Brownie Finn, Jefferson Reid, Ace American is a jingoistic romp through a World War II that never existed.

"Amelia Earhart, Fearless Flyer" – Spinning out of the pages of Ace American! Amelia Earhart faked her death in 1938 and went to work for the American Victory Commission. Now, she uses her Lockheed Elektra to crisscross the time stream to stop the Reich from rising where it shouldn't.

"The Algonquin Four" – Dateline: the 1920s. A celebrated group of New York's sharpest wits met daily at The Algonquin Hotel, enjoying barbs and bon mots.

Starring Mark Gagliardi as Robert Benchley, Annie Savage as Dorothy Parker, James Urbaniak as Woodrow Wilson, and Joshua Malina as Harry Houdini
"The Cross-Time Adventures of Colonel Tick-Tock" – The fey Colonel polices the fractured timeline for Her Majesty's Royal Chrono Patrol, interrupting not-always-terribly-well-researched historical moments and facing down the occasional villain, including the Greenwich Meanie, Auntie Meridian and the occasional dinosaur, from pre-history and all that. Pip pip!
Starring Craig Cackowski as Colonel Tick-Tock, Hal Lublin as Trick Clock and Mark Gagliardi as Queen Victoria

# Captain Laserbeam 

"Captain Laserbeam" – As camp as the old Batman show, facing off against ridiculous villains such as the Numbler, the Die-brarian, and Shape-Ape, Captain Laserbeam protects Apex City while trying not to lose his patience with his excitable Adventurekateers or trip himself up emotionally with the pretty new police commissioner.
Starring John DiMaggio as Captain Laserbeam
