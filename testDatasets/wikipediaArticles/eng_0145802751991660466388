## Centaurus (spacecraft mission)

Centaurus is a mission concept to flyby the Centaurs 2060 Chiron and Schwassmann-Wachmann 1. It was submitted in response to the NASA Discovery program call for proposals in 2019. If selected, this would be the first mission to attempt a flyby of a Centaur.

# Overview 

The launch of Centaurus can occur in any year between 2026 and 2029. The primary targets of the Centaurus mission are the Centaurs 2060 Chiron and Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (often shortened to "SW1"). Centaurs are "escapees" from the Kuiper belt with giant planet-crossing orbits. Both objects are active Centaurs with perihelia within the orbit of Saturn. Centaurus will use imagers and spectrometers to study the surfaces, comae, and any potential rings and shepherd moons around these objects. Use of solar panels will eliminate the need for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) or other nuclear sources.Both mission targets show evidence for rings and/or cometary activity. Chiron is the second largest known Centaur, by diameter, after 10199 Chariklo. Activity has been identified in the past and it may have rings. SW1 is the most active Centaur known, averaging over 7 periods of activity each year. This equates to an outburst of cometary activity approximately every 50 days. Thus, there is a high likelihood of Centaurus flying by SW1 when it is active. No spacecraft has ever explored a minor body the size of Chiron or SW1.

# Mission leadership 

Centaurus is a joint proposal of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboartory (APL) and NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center are also involved. The principal investigator (PI) of the Centaurus mission is Alan Stern of SwRI in Boulder, Colorado. The Deputy PI is Kelsi Singer of SwRI.
