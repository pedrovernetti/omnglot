## Naval ranks and insignia of the Russian Federation

The Navy of the Russian Federation inherited the ranks of the Soviet Navy, although the insignia and uniform were slightly altered. The navy predominantly uses naval-style ranks but also uses army-style ranks for some specialisations, including naval aviation, marine infantry, medical and legal.

Rank titles are sometimes modified due to a particular assignment, branch or status:

The ranks of servicemen assigned to a "guards" unit, formation or ship are preceded by the word “guards”;
The ranks of servicemen in the legal, medical and veterinary branches are followed by “of justice”, “of the medical service”, and “of the veterinary service”, respectively;
The ranks of servicemen in the reserve or in retirement are followed by “of the reserve” or “in retirement”, respectively;
The rank descriptor "of aviation" was officially abolished but is still commonly used, common use of it, however, is being phrased out.
