# History 

Datalogic was founded in 1972 by Eng. Romano Volta in a room in the rectory of the Parish in Quarto Inferiore, on the outskirts of Bologna, in Italy.
Initially, production was centered on electronic devices, but soon the direction changed towards the design and production of photoelectric sensors for textile, ceramic and packaging industries. Due to the need for expansion, the plant was soon moved to the current site of Lippo di Calderara di Reno (BO).The first scan of a barcode in a retail store took place on June 26, 1974. A pack of chewing gum was scanned in a store in Troy, Ohio with a "Magellan Model-A": the world's first fixed retail scanner was signed by Datalogic.
Today, only two copies of the original scanner are still known to exist: one kept at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. and the other is currently exhibited in the museum at the entrance to one of the Datalogic business locations in Eugene, Oregon.In 1984 a Datalogic barcode reader was used at an airport in Milan Linate to sort baggage, the first use of a barcode reader for this purposeThe first RFID application in the world with use in a post office dates back to 1999, while in 2000 the Shopevolution™ middleware was born, the first self-shopping solution involving the use of a small handheld computer with integrated barcode reader.
On June 8, 2009 Romano Volta receives the "Premio Imprese per l’Innovazione” (Business Prize for Innovation) from the President of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano for the company's growth both in Italy and globally resulting from investing in innovative technologies and methods.
