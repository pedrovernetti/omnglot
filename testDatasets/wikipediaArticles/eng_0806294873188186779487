It is located in the McConnell Creek area northeast of Mission, which gets its name from the former name of Cascade Creek, McConnell Creek, which was named for a logger in the area called Jack McConnell. Cascade Creek's outfall is into the southeast end of Stave Lake near Davis Lake Provincial Park.The park was first proposed in 1984 via studies commissioned by the Dewdney-Alouette Regional District and officially inaugurated on June 7, 1986. The land the park comprises was previously part of the Douglas Provincial Forest.Cascade Falls was featured in the final scene of the film Big Bully, as the location of a fight between characters played by Tom Arnold and Rick Moranis.
