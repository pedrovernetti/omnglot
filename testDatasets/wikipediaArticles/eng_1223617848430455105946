## Devletşah Hatun

Devletşah Hatun (fully Devletlu İsmetlu Devlet-Şâh Khānūm / Khātûn Hazretleri, Ottoman Turkish: دولت شاه خاتون , c. 1365 – c. 1414), simply known as Devlet-Şâh, was the third wife of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I and the mother of İsa Çelebi, Mustafa Çelebi the Düzmece, and Musa the Elderly Khan of the Ottoman Empire.

# Biography 

Devlet-Şâh Khānūm was born in 1365 to an Anatolian prince, Süleyman Shah (Şah Çelebi), the ruler of the Anatolian Germiyan dynasty, Kütahya. Her mother Mutāhharā Abide Khātūn was a granddaughter of Mawlānā Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi, the founder of the Sufi order of Mevlevis, through his son Sultan Walad.

# Life 

In 1378, she was married to Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I. She gave birth to three sons: İsa Çelebi, Governor of Anatolia 1390, of Balıkesir, Düzmece ( Phony or False ) Mustafa Çelebi, Sultan of Rumelia, and Büyük (The Elder) Musa Çelebi. Among them, İsa found support with several of the Anatolian principalities but not with Germiyan and Düzmece Mustafa claimed the throne after the death of Mehmed I in 1421 and eventually defeated by Mehmed I'son Murad II. Devlet-Şah Khānūm died in 1414 in Bursa.

# Burial place 

The tomb of Devlet-Şah Khanum stands alone in Bursa neighborhoods separate from the mosque complexes that contained the tombs of the sultans and other members of the dynasty, following two royal mothers, Nilüfer Hatun and Gülçiçek Hatun. It is well tended by the Bursa neighborhood in which it is situated and functions as a local pilgrimage site

# Note 

Germiyanoğlu Devlet Şah Hatun should not be confused with the mother of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed I, namely, Devlet Hatun whose name in her vakfîyya is registered as Daulât bint-i Abd'Allah. This implies that the mother of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed I was non-Turkish origin.
