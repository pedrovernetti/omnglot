The Newtown High School of the Performing Arts (abbreviated as NHSPA) is a government-funded co-educational selective and specialist secondary day school, located in the suburb of Newtown in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the very few performing arts and visual arts schools in Australia. All the students that attend the school are required to study drama, music, dance and visual arts subjects as part of the school’s curriculum for the first year of secondary school. The school participates in a few concerts both on and off campus in all types of performing and visual arts as well as video, technical, costume and design.
The school is run by the New South Wales Department of Education. The current principal is Sharon Roberts.The school caters for approximately 1,000 students from Year 7 to Year 12.

# History 

The school was founded in 1990 as the first state selective high school for performing arts in New South Wales. NHSPA was formed from the merger of the nearby Petersham Girls High School and Newtown Boys High School on the latter's King Street site. Newtown's foundation principal was Robin Amm, formerly the principal at Petersham Girls.
The school remains open and accessible to the local population, however a larger percentage of prospective students from outside the local acceptance boundaries can audition to obtain a place at the school.

# Campus 

The campus is located on King Street, Newtown and bounded by Newman and Whitehorse Streets. The campus has a large paved playground and a grass oval. The various faculties within the school are located in different areas ranging from A to H Blocks and the gymnasium (G block) located near the school oval. The school also has an operational theatre, known as the Studio Theatre, that it uses for its biannual Showcase concerts and other productions. The school also manages the adjacent St Georges Hall which is used for larger productions and school activities.

# Students 

Approximately 65 percent of the student body is recruited through a short audition process. Thirty pupils are in the music class, thirty in drama, and thirty in dance per year, although families living within the catchment area are prioritised to send their children there. Students can audition to gain entry to the school for Years 7 and 11.

# Student leadership 

# Prefect body 

The Prefecture at NHSPA consists of Year 12 students who are elected by both their fellow students and teachers. Its primary role is act as role models for other students and represent the school at any public event.

# Student Representative Council 

Newtown High School of the Performing Arts has an elected Student Representative Council (SRC) composed of two students from each grade. Members are elected for a one-year term by the students. The SRC underwent significant reform in 2004 when the students drafted and adopted a formal constitution, and the council changed from a volunteer institution to its current elected structure. The SRC's primary objectives are to provide input on policy that affects students and to run charity fundraisers.
