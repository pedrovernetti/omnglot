## 2014 Los Angeles Kiss season

The 2014 Los Angeles Kiss season was the franchise's first season in the Arena Football League (AFL). The team was coached by Bob McMillen and played their home games at the Honda Center.
In their inaugural season, the Kiss did well at the box office, finishing second in the AFL (behind Tampa Bay) in attendance, drawing 98,505 fans to nine home games (or 10,945 per game). On the field, though, it was a different story: after winning two of their first three games, LA managed just one victory thereafter, finishing 3â€“15 and missing the playoffs.
