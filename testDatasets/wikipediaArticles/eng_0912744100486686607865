## Canadian federal election results in Suburban Toronto

This is page shows results of Canadian federal elections in the outer parts of Toronto—the area that was the suburban portion of Metro Toronto prior to the 1998 merger.

# Regional profile 

This region was largely rural until the 1960s and its three ridings had usually supported the Progressive Conservatives (Tories). In the 1960s and 1970s as it urbanized and its number of seats increased to seven, it solidly supported the Liberals (Grits) and even gave the New Democratic Party two seats in 1972's tight election. From 1979 until the 1990s its seat split reflected but slightly exaggerated the national result between the Grits and Tories, although it but did not elect any New Democrats. 
By the 1990s, with the large proportion of immigrants in the region and urban growth, its 13 seats became the Liberals' power base for almost two decades. From 1993 to 2008, Liberal candidates swept the region, making this region to the Liberals what Rural Alberta was to the Conservatives. In some ridings, the Liberals defeated their closest opponents by margins of 3-1 or more. Like all of the city of Toronto and most of the urban Greater Toronto Area, the New Democratic Party (NDP) had some pockets of support. The Conservatives didn't even register on the radar screen at first; the centre-right had been more or less nonexistent in the former Metro Toronto since the Progressive Conservatives lost all of their seats here in 1993. Even in the Conservative's minority governments of 2006 and 2008, they won no seats anywhere in Toronto, either suburban or central. 
This changed in 2011, when a slight uptick in Conservative support, combined with vote splitting between the Liberals, NDP and Greens allowed the Conservatives to take six seats in the region - including Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff's Etobicoke—Lakeshore riding - (nearly all by narrow margins, including one by 26 votes) and the national surge of NDP support allowed them to take two in the eastern end of the City. However, even though the Liberals only had four of the now 12 seats (reduced from 13 due to population growth elsewhere in Southern Ontario) the Liberals led slightly in terms of popular vote even though.
The region reverted to form in 2015, as a massive surge in Liberal support allowed the Liberals to win all 14 seats (increased due to intensification, particularly in North York Centre) here en route to taking all of Toronto. In all but one seat (York Center), the Liberals won by 5,500 or more votes.
