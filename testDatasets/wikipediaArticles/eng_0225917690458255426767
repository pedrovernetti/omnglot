## Animorphs (video game)

Animorphs is a 2000 game for Game Boy Color. It is based upon the Scholastic book series Animorphs by K. A. Applegate.

# Gameplay 

The game operates in a series of turn-based battles during combat. In a manner similar to the Pok√©mon video games, the object of Animorphs is to fight and defeat various animals and aliens in order to gain the morph (DNA) of that creature. Sometimes, the player can use the animal's acquired' skills outside combat. For example, snakes crawl up walls, fish swim, and bird morphs take to the air. The game saves using a password system.

# Development 

The game was developed by American studio Runny-Fun and distributed by Ubisoft. Little is currently known about the game's development history.

# Reception 

Critical reception of the game was generally low. Marc Nix of IGN described the game as "pat and boring, but also silly in difficulty at times since there's little guiding your path and no real clue to the strategy." He gave it a score of 3.0 out of 10. Nintendo Power was a bit more favorable in its review of the game, giving it 3 out of 5.
