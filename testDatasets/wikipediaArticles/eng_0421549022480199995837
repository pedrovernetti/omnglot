## Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic

The Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was an autonomous republic of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in the former Soviet Union, and was originally a part of the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On 16 January 1922 the region was detached from the Mountain ASSR and the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Oblast on 1 September 1921. It became an autonomous republic on 5 December 1936. On 30 January 1991, the Kabardino-Balkar ASSR declared state sovereignty. It is now the Kabardino-Balkaria republic, a federal subject of the Russian Federation. The Kabardino-Balkar ASSR bordered no other sovereign states during the existence of the Soviet Union.
Like the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Kabardino-Balkar ASSR was shared by two nationalities. Both autonomous republics resided as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and featured Russians as the ethnic majority.

# History 

The Russian, Ottoman and Persian Empires fought for the region between the 17th and 19th centuries, during which the region was under Russian control. After the October revolution, the region joined the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921, during the Russian Civil War. The territories were detached from the Mountain ASSR to the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Oblast in 1922, and on 5 December 1936 it was renamed the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.In 1944, Supreme Soviet Joseph Stalin accused the Balkars of cooperating with Nazi Germany and deported the entire population to Central Asia. Stalin ceded the Baksan valley to the Georgian SSR. "Balkar" was dropped from the state's name, which was renamed to the Kabardin ASSR. The Balkar population was only allowed to return in 1957 during Khrushchev's leadership, at which point its pre-war name was restored.
