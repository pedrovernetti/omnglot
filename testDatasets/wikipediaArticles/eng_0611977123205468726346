# History 

# From alliance to independence (2006-2007) 

Tanbe10's debut album "Artesh-e Tanbe10", meaning "The Army of Tanbe10" was released in 2007 as an alliance between several Persian gangsta rappers and bands from within the country and abroad including Aemha (Opposite Kingkong band, Germany), Alpha and Moty (Segam band, Iran), Shahinloo, Ali Sufi, Shah MC and Apachi (TM band, Denmark), Mammoth, Tetis (PK Busta band, Iran) and Ali10 (Iran).After this collaboration and well received feedbacks, some of the members decided to quit their former groups to form Tanbe10 as an independent band.

# Divar Records (2007-2008) 

The newly formed group caught the attention of Divar Records founder Ehsan Atour that led them to joining the label alongside famous artists such as Bahram Nouraei, Babak Tighe, Nimosh and Suchmeh in the same year and the release of single tracks like Divar-e Beton and the massive collaboration club hit with the then reformed TM band, entitled Dokhtar-e Bandar.

# The first come back and new members (2008-2009) 

In 2008, the band decided to part ways with Divar Records for personal reasons and conflicts within the group and went silent for about 6 months before coming back with the single track Bargashtim followed by several other well received single tracks. In the same year, the band added two new members Parham Sezar and Pooria Sharlatan through a nomination process and they were introduced to fans with the hit single Bye Bye.

# The bright year (2010-2011) 

2010 was also a bright year for the band with Amir Khalvat joining the team as a new member and the release of the massive hit, Dast Too Jib, a gangsta rap song about enjoying life in Tehran which they dedicated to Zedbazi, a Persian hip-hop pioneer band they admired, following their retirement from music rumors earlier that year.Khalvat separated from the group shortly after, to pursue his musical career as an independent artist.

# Artesh-e Tanbe10 contest (2011-2012) 

After major success in underground musical activities and good past experiences with young talents, Tanbe10 decided to organize a series of competitions to introduce new talents in singing and music production entitled Artesh-e Tanbe10 and TanbeBeat respectively and started their own label "Mishnasi-Maro Records" inspired by their famous slogan Mishnasi Maro (Persian: Mishnāsi Māro, می شناسی مارو) meaning You Know Us.Arteshe Tanbe10 Vol2 was the single track that featured the 10 winners of the competition. It was released in 2011 and was very well received leading to the Introduction of the singer, songwriter and rapper girl, Justina as the first official member of Mishnasi Maro Records, not only defying political rules against underground rap production but also religious ones which precisely restrict women from singing publicly.TanbeBeat contest for music producers was also a hit, featuring best Iranian hip-hop producers of the time, Atour and Alireza JJ as juries. The latter also produced one of the most famous hit singles of the band Hamine ke Hast in 2011.
The second year of Artesh-e Tanbe10 contest was cancelled in final stages due to security problems caused for some of the last year's winners in Iran which led to the discontinuity of both talent seeking contests but H-beatz (Hamid Shekari's pseudonym) was the winner as the mentioned.

# The diss year (2012-2013) 

In 2012, after a series of Facebook comments and insults from one of Tik Taak band's members followed by some of the Paydar alliance members regarding Tanbe10, the group released the hit single diss track "Are!" The grudge caused massive reactions online and was mentioned especially in TV interviews such as GemTV's Cold Spray and AAAmusic's Persian Paparazzi interviews with Erfan, the leader of Paydar alliance. Later that year, Paydar responded with Ye Vajab Az Ma that was followed by the diss track Lol from Tanbe10. This contention is one of the most famous beef stories of Iranian gangsta rap and the two diss tracks from Tanbe10 are usually cited as best diss tracks of Persian hip-hop.

# The second come back (2013-present) 

In 2013, the band went off silent again after the separation of Sezar and Sharlatan from the group and due to personal involvements of the now older band members.After two years, Tanbe10 came back to the hip-hop scene with the 6.3.3 title alongside other famous artists on the "Ampoule album" from 13 Company in 2015 which was played more that 300 thousand times as of October 2016. A few months later the return of Sharlatan to the group was celebrated with another single, Kar-e Maas.
