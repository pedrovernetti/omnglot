A thoroughfare is a road or way connecting one location to another. On land a thoroughfare may refer to anything from a multi-lane highway with grade separated junctions, to a rough trail. Thoroughfares used by a variety of traffic, such as cars on roads and highways. On water a thoroughfare may refer to a strait, channel or waterway.
