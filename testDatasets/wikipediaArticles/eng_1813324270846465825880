## Allium aflatunense

Allium aflatunense (Лук афлатунский) is a species of plant in the amaryllis family, native to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia. It is commonly grown as a garden plant in other regions.

# Description 

Allium aflatunense is a 36-inch-tall (0.9 m) bulbous perennial plant with basal, straplike leaves, and hollow, slightly ribbed scapes (flower stems). The flower heads are dense, globular umbels, about 4 inches (10 cm) across, made up of numerous star-shaped, purplish-pink flowers. It flowers in May and June, with seeds ripening in August. It is commonly sold as a bulb.
Allium aflatunense is often confused with A. hollandicum.

# Cultivation 

Allium aflatunense is generally hardy in USDA zones 4–8. The plant is suitable for use as a cut flower. While it prefers alkaline soil, it can tolerate poor soil conditions, as well as part shade (though it does best in full sun).
