Between the 12 and 16 August 1969, there was an outbreak of political and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Civil rights marches, demanding an end to discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists, had been repeatedly attacked by Ulster Protestant loyalists and also came into frequent conflict with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), the overwhelmingly Protestant police force.
On the night of 14 August 1969, an attack on Clonard Monastery by loyalist mobs begun. Around an hour and a half later, shots rang out from the loyalist side. Fiann Gerald McAuley, only fifteen years old, was shot, and later died. He was anointed where he fell by Fr Egan. who had been watching events unfold from the upstairs window in the Monastery. He would anoint four others within the next hour. Fearing a massacre, he attempted to contact the British Army's general officer commanding (GOC) to request the presence of troops to deter more violence. When the first British soldiers reached the falls road at 7 pm, Fr Egan tried to persuade their commanding officer to move into the Clonard area, though he declined as the soldiers had other orders. Many nearby streets had been set in fire by the loyalists.In the aftermath of the burning of nearby Bombay Street, hundreds of members of the local community gathered in the church of Clonard Monastery, where Fr Patrick Egan delivered a sermon to the Men's Confraternity on the violence he had witnessed and on his hope that peace could be restored. Transcripts and audio recordings of this sermon exist today.
