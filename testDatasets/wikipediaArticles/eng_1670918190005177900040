Akari is a polite, fun-loving and benevolent red-haired girl who is said to be the main protagonist of the series but often pales in comparison to the other characters. She is well-known for her trademark hair buns and her lack of presence, both of which are bantered by other characters, comically.
Kyōko Toshinō (歳納 京子, Toshinō Kyōko)
Voiced by: Yuka Ōtsubo
An optimistic and fun-loving blonde girl who is a year older than Akari and is the more substantial protagonist of the series. Not one to pass up an opportunity for a laugh, she is often causing Yui trouble and crushing on Chinatsu, who resembles her favorite anime character, Mirakurun. She's the object of affection of student council vice-president Ayano, who is in many ways her opposite. Despite her lazy attitude, she often gets high scores in tests after cram sessions. She enjoys eating rum raisin ice cream and is also a talented dōjin artist.
Yui Funami (船見 結衣, Funami Yui)
Voiced by: Minami Tsuda
A cool-headed girl with dark hair who often acts as the voice of reason, Yui is the childhood friend of Akari and Kyōko.

However, on the inside, she is romantic and affectionate towards Kyōko, though she doesn't always show her friendly and responsive side, seeing it as a weakness. Though she may not outwardly show it, she cares about the people around her and sometimes doesn't think of herself, sacrificing her time and energy for the sake of others. She also frequently makes puns and likes crème caramels.

Voiced by: Aki Toyosaki

Another candidate for the Student Council vice-president next year. She has navy blue hair and large breasts, which often leads to her being teased by Sakurako, who is jealous of her early physical development.
