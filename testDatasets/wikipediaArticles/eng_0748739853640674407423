Kolkata Little Magazine Library And Research Center is a privately owned library of alternative and experimental literary magazines in Kolkata, India. It was founded by Sandip Dutta on 23 June 1978 with a small number of periodicals which grew to one of the finest collection of alternative magazines in India. The library is situated at Tamer Lane in College Street "Boipara" neighbourhood of North Kolkata.

# Background 

Kolkata has a prominent place in the history of Little Magazine Movement in India which was largely dominated by Bengali language magazines. This goes back to the foundation of Sabuj Patra in 1914 and Kallol in 1923. The tradition continued with the advent of Post Modernist writing in Bengali Literature. With the arrival of Krittibash, Hungry Generation and periodicals like Kourab many little magazines started to flourish. But there was never a comprehensive preservation attempt made for these immensely valuable cultural items either in the academic or public libraries.

# Foundation 

In 1972,when Sandip Dutta (Then 21 and a student of Scottish Church College in Kolkata majoring in Bengali ) visited the National Library looking for little magazines he found out how they were kept in a condition of utter neglect. According to Dutta he was "shown a heap of books tied in bundles, with more dust and worms in them than pages." Such poor maintenance of periodicals led Dutta, already a little magazine enthusiast at that time, to decide to establish a library dedicated solely to the purpose of collecting and preserving little magazines and promoting their cause. From 27 to 30 September 1972 Dutta held an exhibition of 750 little magazines in protest at his own residence. In 1976 when Calcutta Book Fair started Little Magazines participated in it and Dutta was one of the participants. The Library was born on 23 June 1978 and was called "Library and Laboratory for Bengali Little Magazines" ( "Bangla Samoyikpatra Pathagar O Gobeshona Kendro" ). It was established in the ground floor of Dutta’s two storey ancestral home at 18M Tamer lane off College Street book market. Even now it consists of only two rooms at this place. The library became open for public membership on 8 May 1979.It was officially registered in 1996 and then officially renamed" Kolkata Little Magazine Library and Research Center".

# Funds And Budget 

As from the very beginning the library was founded on the efforts of one individual Dutta faced financial constraints. So he made a piggy bank and names it "Three Penny Opera" after Bertolt Brecht’s famous play of the same name. He also consistently set aside a part of his personal income. Currently the library has an annual budget of approx. Rs 15,000.
