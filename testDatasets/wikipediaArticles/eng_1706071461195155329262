## Youth Olympic Park

Youth Olympic Park is Singapore's very first art park. It is located at Raffles Avenue, at the junction of Raffles Avenue and Bayfront Bridge.

# History 

The Youth Olympic Park was built to cultivate a stronger sense of community ownership and connection with Marina Bay. The park is named after the inaugural Youth Olympic Games, 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. In July 2010, Olympic-themed artwork was installed in the park to further enhance the environment.

# Today 

The park provides shady and cool corners for rest, and offers a good vintage point for photography. A boardwalk connects the park to Marina Promenade, and The Helix Bridge connects the park to Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort.

# Attractions 

One of the attractions in the park is located at the grand steps leading to the entrance of the Helix bridge, where visitors can read a poem titled 'Lion Heart', written by Amanda Chong.
Another attraction that park-goers can visit is the landscaped maze which was developed from works by Aniket Chavan. In the centre of the maze, visitors will see a 4.5-metre-high (15 ft) "mountain", inspired by a drawing by Joyce Seah. There is also a rock wall featuring 18 drawings by youths which depict some of Singapore's most famous icons such as the Merlion, The Esplanade Theatres on the Bay, and HDB flats.
The 'Emo-lightscape' was conceptualised by Mr Kenneth Tan. It is an interactive 'hop-scotch' tiles that will light up when stepped on.
Another interesting installation is by Lui Honfay entitled "The Ribbon Seats".
