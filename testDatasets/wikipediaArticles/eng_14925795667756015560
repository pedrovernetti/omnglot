# Notes 

- On "Black Sheep", Tony Kakko sings different lyrics after the intro. Instead of singing "In love with the maiden, the flower of winter, lowbrow children, in grove of the inland", Tony sings "We're not Iron Maiden, we're not from England, we are Sonata, and we come from Finland." After this, however, Tony sings the lyrics as heard on the Silence album.
- In the middle of "Kingdom for a Heart" they play few lines from "Letter to Dana".
- In the song "Shamandalie", Tony Kakko also changes the line "Time went by" to "Years went by".
- In "Full Moon", Tony changes the lyrics from "Sitting in a corner all alone" to "Standing in a corner all alone", and, at the end of the second verse changes "Mess on the floor again" to "Makes him insane to know".
