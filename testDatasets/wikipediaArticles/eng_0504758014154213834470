The NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament (officially styled as "Championship" instead of "Tournament") is an annual tournament to determine NCAA Division III national champion.
From 1996 to 2012, 2014 to 2018, the NCAA Division III men's basketball championship was held at the Salem Civic Center in Salem, Virginia. The event had been hosted by the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and the City of Salem. Since 2017, the tournament is a 64-team single-elimination tournament, with teams advancing from four regionals to the semifinals and final in Fort Wayne.
For 2013, as part of the celebration of the 75th NCAA Division I tournament, the championship games in both the NCAA Division II and Division III tournaments were played at Philips Arena, now known as State Farm Arena, in Atlanta. From 2014 to 2018, the final game returned to Salem. Currently, the Final Four is held in Fort Wayne, Indiana at Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. For 2020 only, the national semifinals will be played in Fort Wayne, but the championship game will return to Atlanta, with the NCAA choosing to hold the championship games of both Divisions II and III as part of the festivities surrounding the men's Division I Final Four.Wisconsin-Oshkosh is the reigning national champions.
