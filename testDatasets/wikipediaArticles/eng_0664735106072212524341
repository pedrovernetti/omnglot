The Angelou Centre was founded by a collective of women activists and social workers in 1993. The director is Umme Imam, who has previously taught Community and Youth Work at Durham University, and is committed to highlighting the intersections of race and gender.

# Aims 

The centre and its team of support workers, counselors, trainers, facilitators and volunteers provides women with skills training, personal development, employability support and access to welfare. The aim is to provide services to enable women to overcome barriers and achieve economic independence. The Angelou Centre organises meetings and protests to raise awareness of global issues around discrimination, while also organising celebrations, religious festivals, social groups and facilitating informal peer mentoring.
