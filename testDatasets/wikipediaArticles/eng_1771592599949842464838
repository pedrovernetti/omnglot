## Najbolji hrvatski tamburaši

Najbolji Hrvatski Tamburaši (in English Best Croatian Tambura Players) is a Croatian tambura group. 
The group was formed in 1983 as Zlatni Dukati. After a tour of America organized by the Croatian Fraternal Union, the band started to compose more music about Croatia. This came to coincide with the Croatian War of Independence which brought such traditional music back into the spotlight. 
In 1997 the group changed its name from Zlatni Dukati to Najbolji Hrvatski Tamburaši. The band was signed to Croatia Records.
