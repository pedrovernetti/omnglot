WJHD-FM first went into service on October 16, 1972 (using only a 10-watt RCA BTE-10C exciter and transmitter, two AR turntables, and a Shure mixer). Father Geoffrey Chase served as the station trustee during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In the late '80s to early '90s, the station operated on a transmitter operating at 360 watts. During most of those years, the station was operational only nights and weekends, playing classical music.In 1999, Father Edmund assumed responsibility for managing the staff and setting the operating hours. Debuting "The Blue Monk," Edmund's show played requests for faculty, parents, and members of the Rhode Island State Police who were listening while on patrol.
