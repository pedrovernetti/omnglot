## Basir

Basir is an Iranian artillery fired laser-guided, 155 mm explosive projectile designed to destroy enemy tanks, vehicles and other moving or non-moving targets with high precision. This weapon is similar in function with Russian Kransnopol or American M712 Copperhead. Basir put Iran among the five countries in the world with laser targeting technology.These shells were unveiled on January 30, 2012, on the first day of the so-called "Daheye Fajr", a key point during the Islamic Revolution by defense minister Ahmad Vahidi. He later added that this system is very useful in mountainous areas.
Iranian TV showed some footage of the weapon being fired from an HM 41 at land and sea targets. It has a reported range of 20 km.
