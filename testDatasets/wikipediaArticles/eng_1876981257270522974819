## Sciberras Peninsula

The Sciberras Peninsula is a strip of land in the South Eastern Region of Malta, between the Grand Harbour in the south and Marsamxett Harbour in the north. It is called a peninsula, despite the absence of an isthmus, and at the end of this feature stands the Mount Sciberras, which gave its name to the peninsula. During the Arab occupation the peninsula was called Mu'awiya, which has been taken up in Maltese as Xagħriet Mewwija (uncultivated and undulating heaths).The capital of Valletta is located on the Sciberras Peninsula, as is the suburb Floriana.The name comes from the old Maltese family name Sciberras or Xiberras, who would have owned the land.
