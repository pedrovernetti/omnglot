Roughly the size of Oregon, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, or Y-K Delta, covers 75,000 square miles (190,000 km2) in the southwestern corner of Alaska. It is located where the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers empty into the Bering Sea on the west coast of Alaska. The delta, which mostly consists of tundra, is protected as part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. 
Bethel – Within the heart of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta lays Bethel, a hub community for 56 surrounding villages, the gateway to the Yukon Delta, and home to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation. Roughly 400 miles (600 km) west of Anchorage, Bethel is charged by a maritime climate that averages 65–70°F during the summer months, and a winter mean of 11 °F. 
The Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation also has five sub-regional clinics that can provide many of the same services found at the Bethel Hospital site. The clinics are located in:
Aniak – Located on the south bank of the Kuskokwim River and at the head of the Aniak Slough, 92 miles (150 km) northeast of Bethel.
