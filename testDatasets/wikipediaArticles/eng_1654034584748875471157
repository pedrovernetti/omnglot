## Consistent eschatology

Consistent eschatology (Thoroughgoing eschatology) is an exclusive futuristic eschatology, the consistent interpretation of Jesus' eschatology as an expectation of an imminent end, and the thorough-going eschatology, the first position by Albert Schweitzer. He used a thorough eschatology to provide a solution to the historical problems associated with Jesus' life. According to this view, the proclamation of Jesus asserted by Johannes Weiss (J. Wei√ü) and his actions and ministry are dominated by the eschatological expectation of the impending return. It is contrast to realized eschatology, which sees that the kingdom of God is not in the future but is already completed in the ministry of Jesus Christ. It has evolved into inaugurated eschatology which started the synthesis of the consistent eschatology by Albert Schweitzer and realized eschatology by C. H. Dodd.
