# History 

De Volewijckers was one of a number of Dutch football clubs that were successful in post-war leagues before being forced to merge to cope with the popularity of bigger teams such as Ajax and Feyenoord. In 1942, they were promoted to the top tier of Dutch football to become the biggest club in Amsterdam. They played their home games at Mosveld in Amsterdam-Noord but moved to Ajax' Stadion de Meer during the Second World War after Mosveld was bombed. In 1944, they were crowned Dutch league champions. Formerly amateur, they became a professional club in 1954 and played in the Eredivisie from 1961 through 1963. They were forced to leave Mosveld in 1964 and were moved to a new complex in Buiksloterbanne.
In 1974, the club merged with Blauw Wit and DWS to form FC Amsterdam. De Volewijckers continued as an amateur club. It merged with DWV to form DVC Buiksloot in summer 2013.
