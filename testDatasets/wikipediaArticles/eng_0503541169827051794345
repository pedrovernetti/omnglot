It was built in about 1948, after the original school was destroyed by fire. It is a one-story, stuccoed masonry building with a gable roof. It features a concrete block covered entrance. The school was organized after school reforms of the early 20th century mandated that the children of the strongly Native American families of the Nanticoke be placed in the same schools as African-American students.It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
