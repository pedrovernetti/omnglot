## Greater Perth

Greater Perth is Perth's Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA), a geographical area designed to represent the functional extent of Western Australia's (WA) capital city.The Greater Perth GCCSA does not define the built up edge of the city, but reflects the capital city labour market, using the 2006 Census travel to work data. The labour market is sometimes used as a de facto measure of the functional extent of a city since it contains the majority of the commuting population.GCCSAs were designed to provide a stable and consistent boundary that reflects the functional extent of each of Australiaâ€™s capital cities. This definition was designed to include those within the urban area of the city as well as people who regularly socialise, shop or work within the city, but live in small towns and rural areas surrounding the city.Greater Perth consists of the area defined by the Perth metropolitan region, with the City of Mandurah and the Pinjarra Level 2 Statistical Area of the Shire of Murray.The population of Greater Perth at the 2011 Census was 1,728,867. At June 2013 it was estimated at 1.97 million and is projected to increase to between 4.4 million and 6.6 million by 2061.In 2013 Greater Perth had a population density of 310 inhabitants per square kilometre (800/sq mi), while the rest of WA had 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi). In the year to 2013, the density of Greater Perth increased by 10 inhabitants per square kilometre (26/sq mi).
