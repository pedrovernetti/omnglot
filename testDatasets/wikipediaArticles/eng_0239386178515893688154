# History 

The earliest record of a city on this site is the Roman town of Alaunia in 909. That city was at the bottom of the hill, but was destroyed by invading barbarians in the 10th century. The residents moved the city to the top of the hill and built a castle for defense. The castle was destroyed during the Wars of Religion but the city itself survived.
