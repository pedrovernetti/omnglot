## General Hospital of Paris

Under the Ancien Régime the General Hospital of Paris (French: Hôpital général de Paris) was not primarily intended as a medical facility but a place of confinement of the poor. Constructed by lay devotees (the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement) during the reign of Louis XIII, it was intended to solve the recurring problem of begging and the Cour des miracles.
