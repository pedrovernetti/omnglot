# Plot 

Two 23-year-olds, Erik and Phillip, dream of becoming successful writers. They idolize the reclusive writer Sten Egil Dahl (a character modelled on Tor Ulven). When they both try to get a manuscript published, Erik's is rejected. Phillip's, on the other hand, is accepted and he becomes a star of the Norwegian literary scene overnight. Phillip meets Kari, with whom he falls in love after inviting her on a trip to Paris. Six months later, Erik and his friends pick up Phillip at a psychiatric hospital to bring him home after a long treatment for his psychosis that was triggered by his obsessive love for Kari. Erik still hasn't given up his dream, but Phillip isn't able to write anymore, although his friend encourages him to make a new effort. Instead Phillip tries to get his ruined relationship with Kari to start over again from the beginning by asking her to return with him to Paris in a futile attempt to replicate their first trip. But once Philip realizes he doesn't love Kari anymore, they go their separate ways.
Meanwhile, Erik's revised manuscript gets published, but is met with poor reviews, and his girlfriend dumps him for neglecting her. The same day, Philip asks Erik to read his new writing and give feedback. Erik is honest and tells Philip it isn't his best work, needs improvements, but has potential, and he's glad Philip has started writing again. Philip lacks confidence in his writing, saying it's just recycled Dahl and Ulven, and is upset with Erik because he believes Erik is just trying to avoid hurting his feelings with nice comments. After Philip also calls Erik's novel recycled Dahl, Erik angrily leaves. Disgruntled by these events, Erik expresses his anger by kicking some parked vehicles and gets knocked out by one of their owners. He then goes to a park, only to be knocked out again by Sten Egil Dahl's dog. Erik wakes up in Dahl's home, and Dahl provides Erik with constructive feedback on his writing, including insights on how to write more authentically. This renews Erik's self-confidence, while prompting him to realize he must get out of Oslo to become a successful writer. Meanwhile, Philip, regretting his mistakes with Kari, goes to her workplace and tells her that he loves her and their love was always meant to be. But when Kari responds that she can take no more, he collapses on the floor. Erik goes to visit Philip at the hospital, but decides against meeting with him.
Erik moves to Paris without saying any goodbyes and imagines a succession of future events: he writes a second novel, which is a huge success back in Norway; after a year of living abroad, he decides to return home for a friend's wedding and reunites with his friends, including Philip, who is together with Kari again; Philip tells Erik he and Kari are happy and he likes his new book; Philip says he is most likely not going to write again, unless "the spirit will move him again"; Philip's comments inspire Erik to continue work on his next novel; Erik flies back to Paris.
