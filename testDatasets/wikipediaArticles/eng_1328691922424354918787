## Melvin School

The Melvin School is a former homestead located at 4950 S. Laredo St. in Aurora, Colorado. It was moved to its current site from its original location, 3 miles away. It was built in 1922.
The structure has undergone extensive renovation, including a rebuilding of the belfry, which was done using old pictures as a guide. Inside the structure, there is a museum and library in one room and an authentically-restored classroom that shows the interior of a typical rural school from the 1920s.
