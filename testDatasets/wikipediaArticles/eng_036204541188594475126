## Three Rivers District (VHSL)

The A Three Rivers District is a high school conference of the Virginia High School League which draws most of its members from the New River Valley. The lone exception is Glenvar High School, which is located in western Roanoke County. The district is named for the New River, Roanoke River, and Little River. This river association was even further expanded with the addition of Alleghany and James River High Schools, bringing the Cowpasture, Jackson, and James Rivers into the conversation as well. The schools in the Three Rivers District compete in A Region C with the schools of the A Hogoheegee District, the A Mountain Empire District and the A Pioneer District.http://www.threeriversdistrictva.org/g5-bin/client.cgi?G5genie=308 This needs to updated
