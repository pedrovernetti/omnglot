## Mos Speedrun

Mos Speedrun is an 8-bit retro-style game by British developer Physmo, released in April 2011 for iOS. Gameplay revolves around clearing levels and collecting coins as quickly as possible but forgoes the virtual d-pad typically used by iOS platformers in favor of a simplified two button control system.
