The 2018–19 Welsh Alliance League, known as the Lock Stock Welsh Alliance League for sponsorship reasons, was the 35th season of the Welsh Alliance League, which consisted of two divisions: the third and fourth levels of the Welsh football pyramid.
There were fifteen teams in each division, with the champions of Division 1 promoted to the new FAW Championship North & Mid and the bottom two were relegated to Division 2. In Division 2, the champions and runners-up were promoted to Division 1. No team was relegated from Division 2 as Meliden resigned from the Welsh Alliance League at the end of the season.
The season began on 11 August 2018 and concluded on 18 May 2019.
