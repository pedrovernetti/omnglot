## Tony O'Shea

Anthony O'Shea (born 9 May 1961 from Stockport) is an English professional darts player who competes in British Darts Organisation events. He was born in Stockport and is of Irish descent. His squat figure has resulted in the nickname Silverback. He has reached the finals of seven BDO major darts tournaments, but to date has never won one. He also acts as a regular commentator for televised BDO coverage.

# Career 

In 2002 he made his debut at the BDO World Darts Championship, narrowly losing to former Masters champion Colin Monk 3–2. O'Shea returned the following year and beat former champion Ted Hankey 3–2 in the first round, before once again being beaten by Monk 3–2 - this time in the deciding leg of the deciding set. Two years thereafter he reached the semi-finals after a winning streak defeating Gary Anderson, Gary Robson and Ted Hankey before he eventually went out against Mervyn King 5–1. Later that year he had his best chance to date of winning a major title, as he led King 5–3 in the final of the Winmau World Masters before King recovered to win 6–5.
O'Shea managed to achieve a televised nine dart finish against Adrian Lewis during the 2007 International Darts League on 9 May 2007 which made the tournament the first in darts history to witness two perfect legs. The occasion was made even sweeter as he was celebrating his 46th birthday.
In the 2008 World Championship, O'Shea defeated Steve Farmer in the first round, but was defeated by Winmau World Masters champion Robert Thornton in the second round.
O'Shea won the 2008 Welsh Masters, only his second tournament victory. In the 2009 BDO World Championship, O'Shea defeated Anderson in the quarter finals, his best friend Darryl Fitton in the semi final, but was once again second-best in a major final as he lost to Hankey 7–6 in what Tony Green described as the best final since 1992.
O'Shea entered the 2009 Winmau World Masters as the number one seed but despite 3–0 wins overs Dave Prins and 8th seed Joey ten Berge, he lost in the semi-finals to defending champion Martin Adams who successfully retained his title. O'Shea then won the WDF World Cup men's singles title with victory over ten Berge in the final, in what was arguably his most significant win to date.
O'Shea entered the 2010 BDO World Championship as the number one seed. He had a tough first round against World Masters runner up Robbie Green but came through it 3–2. He then saw off Stephen Bunting 4–0 to reach his 4th Quarter Final. He managed a 5–1 victory over Robert Wagner in the Quarter finals and went on to meet Dave Chisnall in the semi-final who had beaten Fitton in the first round, former Masters champion Tony West in the second round, and defending champion Hankey in the quarter-final. O'Shea, despite taking the first two sets, was beaten 6–3 by Chisnall and saw his World Championship dream end for another year. Martin Adams went on to defeat Chisnall in the final.
O'Shea won all three group games in the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, defeating Vincent van der Voort 5–1, James Wade 5–1 and Justin Pipe 5–4. He then lost 10–7 to Terry Jenkins in the second round.
In contrast in 2010 where he was world number one, O'Shea came into the 2011 BDO World Darts Championship as the number eight seed and suffered a shock first round loss to Ross Smith.
O'Shea was seeded at the 2012 BDO World Championship, O'Shea put his successful run in the 2012 world championships down to his work with professional sports mind coach and hypnotherapist Stephen McKibben from belfast who has worked with great success for other sports professionals. He beat Steve West in the first round, hitting a 140 checkout and 142 checkout in consecutive legs at the end of the match, before defeating Ross Montgomery in the second round. He then beat defending champion Martin Adams 5–2 in the quarter-finals, hitting a 170 checkout in the fourth set and thanked mind coach Stephen McKibben for enabling him to at last beat Martin Adams in a major tournament. O'Shea followed this up with a 6–5 victory over Dutch débutant Wesley Harms to reach his second World Championship final, where he was defeated by another Dutch débutant, Christian Kist, 7–5.
In October 2012, O'Shea reached his sixth major final at the 2012 Winmau World Masters, and was beaten by Stephen Bunting.
Tony O'Shea reached his third World Championship final in 2013 after a high quality run. He struggled badly in the final, losing to Scott Waites 7–1 with an average of 81.90. O'Shea became the first man to lose his first three BDO World Championship finals, and only the second player to lose his first three world finals in either the BDO or PDC after Peter Manley.
In 2018, he will not be at the World Championships for the first time in his career.

# PDC 

O’Shea will transfer from the BDO to the PDC in January. And will attempt to win a Tour Card for the next two seasons. He missed participation in Lakeside 2018 after finishing the BDO season at 55th place. He did not earn a tour card after participating in the four day event. As a result he returned to the BDO and participated in the Dutch Open reaching the last 32.
