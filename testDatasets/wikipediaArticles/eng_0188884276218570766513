## The Reunion (Capone-N-Noreaga album)

The Reunion is the second studio album by rap duo Capone-N-Noreaga. It is not as critically acclaimed as their first album, The War Report, but did feature a number of well-received tracks, most notably "Invincible," produced by east coast producer/DJ DJ Premier. Because of a manufacturing error, the album was released with two catalog numbers.

# Critical reception 

A writer for HipHopDX commended the duo for maintaining their "lyrical chemistry" and the beats from DJ Premier ("Invincible"), The Alchemist ("Bang Bang") and Mobb Deep ("Queens Finest") but felt the rest of the track listing lacked the thug intensity found in their debut effort, concluding that "Overall, The Reunion is a mediocre album, not bad but not great either." Despite highlighting both "Bang Bang" and "Invincible" as standout tracks, AllMusic's Matt Conaway saw the record as a "step backward" for the duo, with guest contributions being "more detrimental than beneficial", saying it "sounds like a hurried project, one where the material has been compromised just to get product on the streets."
