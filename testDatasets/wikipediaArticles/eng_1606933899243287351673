## Fire in the Kitchen

Fire in the Kitchen is a compilation album recorded by The Chieftains, in collaboration with an array of Canadian folk musical guests, and released in 1998.
The Chieftains, who were touring Canada that year, had not originally intended to release an album, but unexpectedly ended up recording a number of informal live sessions with guest musicians. The resulting album was billed primarily as a compilation, rather than a Chieftains album per se, although the Chieftains appear on all of the album's tracks.
