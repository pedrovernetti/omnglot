# Plot 

Alex Prevost – kidnapped, savagely beaten, suspended from the ceiling of an abandoned warehouse in a wooden cage – is running out of time. Her abductor appears to want only to watch her die. Apart from a shaky eyewitness report, Police Commandant Camille Verhœven has nothing to go on: no suspects, no leads.
To find the young woman, the detective - a man with a tragic past and extraordinary abilities as an investigator - must first understand more about her.

# Summary 

Part I
The plot is thrown open with the abduction of a 30 year old beautiful woman, Alex Prevost with an unreliable eyewitness who identifies 'a white van' as the abduction vehicle. Citing similarities to his wife's abduction and murder a couple of years ago, Police Commandant Camille Verhœven reluctantly accepts the case. The futile interrogation at the crime scene yields no leads and he sends an indecipherable sliver of nameplate (of the van) caught on a CCTV camera to the forensics' team.
The kidnapper places Alex, unclad, in a wooden cage and leaves it hanging off the ground in a defunct mill. He supplies her with dog food and water and abandons her, to return briefly, to click her snaps on his phone.
The van is traced to belong to 53 year old John-Pierre Trarieux. Upon recognizing the ambush set up by the police at his home, Trarieux makes a narrow escape and drives off to downtown Paris only to be cornered on a bridge. Trarieux jumps off the bridge to his death instead of surrendering. Verhœven finds Alex's pictures on his phone and another picture (in print) of Trariuex's son Pascal posing with another girl. They think of a possible link between Pascal's disappearance and Alex's kidnapping and interrogate the people with whom Trarieux had established communication prior to the abduction. This leads them to Sandrine - Alex's former roommate who identifies the girl with Pascal as Nathalie (a false name assumed by Alex) - and discover Pascal's body buried in her backyard under a water harvesting project which had been abruptly implemented by Nathalie before her untimely departure. Pascal's body had been scoured by sulphuric acid and Camille recollects two other deaths with a similar Modus operandi and postulates that Nathalie/Alex could have been a serial murderer.
Verhœven receives crucial information about Alex's location. Simultaneously, Alex smears her own blood onto the hemp rope holding her cage in place to lure rats to nibble upon the rope. The rope eventually snaps and the cage breaks apart as it falls on the floor. Alex escapes before the police get to the scene.
Part II
Verhœven convinced of Alex's involvement in the preceding two murders, interrogates the relatives of the victims - Stefen Maciak and Brenard Gattegno. Their respective wives identify Alex on a E-FIT, albeit by a different name, consolidating Verhœven's theory about Alex. Another murder of a hotel owner in Toulouse, Jacqueline Zanette, a middle aged women, leaves Verhœven puzzled. They trace Alex's current residence to a rental accommodation run by a landlady who informs them about Alex's preterm annulment of the rental contract sighting 'family problems' and of moving out luggage ensuite, a few days prior. This as well as Alex's luggage traced to a storage unit in Paris, both prove to be dead ends.
Alex on the other hand returns to Paris and arranges a dinner date with Felix Maniere. She seduces him and kills him (her fifth murder) at his own residence. Alex then makes plans to abscond to Germany and hitchhikes a ride with truck driver Robert Praderie. Upset by her decision of abandoning her hometown Paris, she commits her sixth murder (Robert) and returns to Paris and instead decides to reroute her itinerary, booking a flight to Switzerland. She checks into a hotel near the airport and calls her brother to schedule a meeting for later that night. She gets inebriated, bangs her head on the wash basin and empties a bottle of barbiturates into her mouth, committing suicide.
Part III
The hotel staff who discover Alex's body recounts seeing her dumping her belongings in a bin in the parking lot. Verhœven finds Alex's secret diary among her effects procured in the garbage bin. The diary puts Alex in a completely different light, for in it, she has shared incidents of being raped by her half brother at the age of 12. It delves into her memories of being prostituted by her brother to the men whose life she ended during her killing rampage. Her autopsy brings to light a barbaric act of genital mutilation by acid, inflicted upon her by one of her rapists. Her brother, Thomus Vasseur, after much denial finally owns up to his doings and is appropriately convicted for his crimes.
