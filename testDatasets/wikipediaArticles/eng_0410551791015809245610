## CHCH Television Tower

The CHCH Television Tower is a 357.5 metre 1,173 feet-high guyed TV mast located at 481 First Road West in Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada. The tower houses the primary transmitter for the independent television station CHCH-DT as well as that of CITS-DT, the flagship of the religious Yes TV television system. It is currently the fourth-tallest structure in Canada.
When completed in 1960, the CHCH Television Tower became the tallest structure in Canada. Only six structures built since then have surpassed its height: the CN Tower in Toronto (completed in 1976), the Cape Race LORAN-C transmitter (completed in 1963, collapsed in 1993), the CBC Tower (Mont-Carmel) (completed in 1972, destroyed in 2001), the Inco Superstack in Sudbury (completed in 1971) and the original and replacement guyed mast(s) of the CKX-TV Tower (completed in 1973, collapsed in 1983, rebuilt in 1985). The CHCH tower ranks thirteenth in height among the tallest structures in the Commonwealth of Nations.
The mast is located on the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, so when viewed from the bottom of the escarpment it appears to be exceptionally tall.
