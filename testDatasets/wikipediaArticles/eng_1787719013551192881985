## Numidio Quadrato (Rome Metro)

Numidio Quadrato is a station on the Rome Metro. It is on Line A and is located in the Quadraro district of Rome, under the intersection of Via Tuscolana and Via Scribonio Curione. The station is named after Via Numidio Quadrato, a nearby road demolished in 1980.
The station features many mosaic art works as a part of Rome Metro art programs.
The platforms in this station are much larger than most stations on Line A. This is because it was originally planned to be a transfer station with Line D. This is no longer a possible situation as Line D has been rerouted to another part of Rome.
