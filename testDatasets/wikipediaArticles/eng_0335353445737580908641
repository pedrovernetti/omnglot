## Tom Stone (TV series)

Tom Stone is a crime drama series that ran in Canada on CBC Television for two 13-episode seasons beginning on March 25, 2002. In the United States, the series is syndicated by PPI Releasing and Sony Pictures Television under the title Stone Undercover.

# Overview 

The hour-long series, which is set on location in Calgary and surrounding Alberta locations, stars Chris William Martin in the title role, a roguish character with a colorful past: He was a cop, an oil rigger and an ex-con. His background provides the perfect ingredients the Royal Canadian Mounted Police need to help them in solving cases that require an outsider.
Assisting him in these assignments is RCMP Corporal Marina Di Luzio (Janet Kidder), a female by-the-book type commercial crime specialist who has an on again-off again friction with the unconventional Stone, which also carries over into the cases they're assigned to. In addition, there is also Tom's American scotch-and-cigar smoking buddy, Jack Welsh (Stuart Margolin). Canadian actor Art Hindle also had a recurring role as Neil McQuinn, a shady but well connected businessman.

# Trivia 

The series is similar to The Rockford Files, and like that series, also has the character living in a trailer home.
In addition, Margolin, who starred in The Rockford Files, is also the series director.
Stone also drives a Pontiac Firebird.
