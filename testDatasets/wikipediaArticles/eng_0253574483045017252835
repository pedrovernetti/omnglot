# Content 

The song "lists a number of noises everyone is familiar with, but uses each as a symbol. In the first verse it’s the morning shower, the coffee pot and a door locking. All these mean the main character will be spending a few hours apart from his lover."

# Critical reception 

An uncredited review from Taste of Country was favorable, saying that "a young lover’s song that relies on an older couple to recall those early days when eight hours at work seemed like eight years away from a familiar pair of lips.…'I Like the Sound of That' recalls the days of the band’s biggest hits. Once again they make love sound easy."

# Commercial performance 

The song first entered the Billboard's Country Airplay chart at No. 40 on chart dated October 10, 2015, and entered the Hot Country Songs chart at No. 45 a week later. For the week ending April 30, 2016, the song reached number-one on the Country Airplay chart, becoming the trio's thirteenth number-one hit, and their first since "Banjo" in 2012.
