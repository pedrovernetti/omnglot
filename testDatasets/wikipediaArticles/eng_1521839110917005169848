## Waknatoy

Waknatoy, also called Marikina menudo, is a Filipino pork stew with pickles. It is a variant of the Filipino menudo stew originating from Marikina City. It is made with cubed pork and pork liver with sausages (typically Chorizo de Bilbao), red and green bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and distinctively, pickle relish, cooked in a tomato-based sauce with salt, pepper, fish sauce, and bay leaves. Waknatoy does not traditionally include other vegetables like potatoes and carrots, like menudo, but they can be included.
