## Ivirua (Cook Islands electorate)

Ivirua is a Cook Islands electoral division returning one member to the Cook Islands Parliament. Its current representative is Jim Marurai, who has held the seat since he won it in a by-election in 1997.
The electorate consists of the districts of Ivirua and Karanga on the island of Mangaia. It was created in 1981, when the Constitution Amendment (No. 9) Act 1980 adjusted electorate boundaries and split the electorate of Mangaia into three.
