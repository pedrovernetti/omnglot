## From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing

From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing was released in 1977 and is the ninth album by Michael Nesmith and eighth studio album as a singer/songwriter during his post-Monkees career. The album was Nesmith's second with vocals released on his own label, Pacific Arts.
The song, "Love's First Kiss," is rare example of Nesmith collaborating with other songwriters to compose a song.
Nesmith released one single in the United States from Radio Engine, the song "Rio". Because of the length of the song, approximately 3 minutes were edited out of the song for the release of the single. Additionally, Nesmith recorded a promotional video for the track, "Rio", which was created by Nesmith, William Dear, and William E. Martin. In other areas of the world where "Rio" gained chart success (such as England and Australia), a follow-up single, "Navajo Trail" b/w "Love's First Kiss", was issued.
