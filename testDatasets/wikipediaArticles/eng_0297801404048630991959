He is also a member of the following organisations: World Shipping Council; International Advisory Panel of the Singapore Maritime Institute; Singapore Advisory Panel of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.On 9 June 2016, it was announced that Temasek will tender its NOL shares to CMA. Ng, as the then-CEO of NOL, said that "without the scale necessary to compete on costs, the best choice was to sell." and "compared with our competitors, we also didn't have the scale" as the primary reason for the sale of Singapore's shipping icon. As a result, Maersk Line and CMA CGM were reported to be interested to acquire NOL and eventually, CMA CGM emerged as the buyer.
Ng defended his performance at NOL as "NOL's past successes were built on its business model as a premium service line... This was always the way for NOL, even before the 2008 financial crash, and it did well." He then acknowledged that the company had been "a bit slow and reluctant to change".
Following the sale of NOL to CMA CGM, Mr Ng eventually relinquished his role as chief executive of NOL. Thus, effectively when Temasek tenders all of its 66.8 per cent stake.
