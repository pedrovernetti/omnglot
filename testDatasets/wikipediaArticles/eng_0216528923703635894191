## Headache (song)

"Headache" is a single written and performed by Frank Black. It was the sole released single from his second solo album Teenager of the Year, released in 1994. It reached number 53 on the UK charts and number 10 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks.Co-produced by Black and Eric Drew Feldman (who had contributed to the Pixies' Trompe le Monde), the "blissfully anthemic" song would later appear on greatest hits compilations for Black. The A.V. Club said the song, "embodies all of the off-kilter charm and undeniable catchiness that’s made Thompson’s work so timeless." Interviewer Sean O'Neal described it as, "one of the greatest pop songs ever written." The Quietus said, "The tune is as deliciously catchy and Orbinsonesque as anything he’d previously written, but underlaid throughout the verse with a bassline that keeps ascending to denote pressure, it culminates in a remarkable chorus that sounds like pop’s most mellifluous migraine."The black and white video for the song was directed by Adam Bernstein, famous at the time for his work with They Might Be Giants.
