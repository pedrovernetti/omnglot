## Eurasia Group

Eurasia Group is a political risk research and consulting firm founded in 1998 by Ian Bremmer, with offices in New York City, Washington, DC, London, Tokyo, São Paulo, San Francisco, Brasilia, and Singapore. The firm provides analysis and expertise about how political developments move markets and shape investment environments across the globe. In 2010, Patrick Tucker of the World Future Society described Eurasia Group as "the world’s largest political-risk consultancy," while Bremmer has been referred to as the "guru" in the field by The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, in addition to being credited with bringing political science as a discipline to financial markets.

# History 

Ian Bremmer founded Eurasia Group in 1998. The group was originally based out of a cubicle in the World Policy Institute in New York City. The company subsequently opened offices in London, Washington, DC, Tokyo, San Francisco, São Paulo, Brasilia and Singapore.
In 2001, Bremmer and Eurasia Group created the Global Political Risk Index (GPRI). In 2004, the firm expanded beyond emerging markets to cover frontier markets. Eurasia Group released its first annual Top Risks report in 2006.
Following the 2008 financial crisis, Eurasia Group expanded its coverage to developed markets, starting with the United States and later Europe. It also created a Comparative Analytics practice to develop new products and methodologies for measuring political risk. In 2012, Eurasia Group formed its Emerging Markets Strategy group to analyze trends that cut across emerging markets.
In 2014, Bremmer recruited former heads of state, cabinet ministers, and other persons to Eurasia Group's Senior Advisor program, including former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, former United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown, former Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird, and former Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski.
Eurasia Group hosted its first Geopolitical Summit (later named the GZERO Summit) in Tokyo in 2017, using the forum to explore global risks and opportunities facing multinational companies. Two years later, it expanded its GZERO Events platform to include an annual forum in Brazil.
Also in 2017, Eurasia Group launched GZERO Media to create news coverage of global affairs. GZERO Media produces a weekly digital and US national public television show, GZERO World with Ian Bremmer, in which Bremmer explains that week's global stories, conducts interviews, and satirizes current affairs in Puppet Regime, featuring puppets representing world leaders and Bremmer himself.

# Top 10 Risks 

In 2006, Eurasia Group launched its first Top Risks report and has produced the report every January since then. Available to the general public, the report is a forecast of the key geopolitical risks for the year ahead, along with notable red herrings, issues that, despite media attention, are unlikely to pose a significant threat or drive instability in the coming year. Eurasia Group keeps each Top Risks report posted on its website.
In January 2011, Eurasia Group's Top Risk was the G-Zero world, where "the world's major powers set aside aspirations for global leadership—alone, coordinated, or otherwise—and look primarily inward for their policy priorities. Key institutions that provide global governance become arenas not for collaboration but for confrontation." In a G-Zero world, "The U.S. lacks the resources to continue as primary provider of public goods, and rising powers are too preoccupied with problems at home to welcome the burdens that come with international leadership." The concept gained traction at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos in 2011 as well as in an episode of Planet Money shortly after the 2011 Top Risks report was released. Bremmer expanded on the theme of the G-Zero world in his 2012 book Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World. It has also been covered in The Telegraph and The New York Times. By the time of the 2019 G20 Summit in Osaka, French and Spanish media suggested that the G-Zero world the firm predicted was imminent.
In January 2012, Eurasia Group announced that the "end of the 9/11 era" was its Top Risk for the year. The report described a "world where politics and economics overlap almost entirely" and where investors will become increasingly risk-averse and the baseline of risk becomes exaggerated. Other risks included G-Zero and the Middle East, the Eurozone, the United States during its presidential election year, North Korea, Pakistan, China, Egypt, South Africa, and Venezuela.In January 2013, Eurasia Group announced that "the era of Emerging Market abundance is finished" and listed volatility in emerging markets as the year's Top Risk. The report broke down emerging markets into those "becoming developed," "still emerging—and problematically so," and "backsliding." In addition, it outlined the downside risk of markets in each category. Also listed as Top Risks in the report were China v. information, Arab summer, Washington politics, JIBs (Japan, Israel, Britain, Europe, East Asian geopolitics, Iran, India, and South Africa.In 2014, the firm's Top Risk was "America's troubled alliances." The report stated that: "Washington's second-tier allies will begin to shift their international orientation in response to a weakening US foreign policy." Other risks included diverging markets, petrostates, strategic data, and Al Qaeda 2.0."The Politics of Europe" was the Top Risk of 2015. That year's report stated, "Europe's economics are in substantially better shape than at the height of the Eurozone crisis, but the politics is now much worse ... That's true on three different levels: bottom-up, intra-EU, and outside-in." It also cited "the weaponization of finance"—a description of the ways the United States uses its influence to affect global outcomes—and weak incumbents among the year’s risks.In 2016, Eurasia Group's Top Risk was "the hollow alliance," a reference to the trans-Atlantic partnership. The report's authors wrote, "The world’s most important alliance for nearly seventy years ... is now weaker, and less relevant, than at any point in decades". The year's other risks included the rise of technologists, unpredictable leaders, and not enough elections.
The following year, the group predicted in its annual forecast that the trend toward a world without a global leader would continue in 2017. That year's report described the era as "a period of geopolitical recession" and said that the continued "populist revolt" against globalism was evidenced by the United Kingdom's departure from the EU (Brexit) the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and Donald Trump's election as president of the United States, among other events of 2016.Returning to the previous year's theme of a geopolitical recession, Eurasia Group predicted in 2018 that the world was "closer to geopolitical depression" than "a reversion to past stability." The year's Top Risk was China's alternative to the leadership vacuum left by the United States, and other risks were the global tech cold war, US-Iran relations, and a new age of protectionism.In 2019, Eurasia Group's Top Risk was "bad seeds," referring to the fraying of US alliances, erosion of the European Union, and the deepening discord between the world's major economies. The company noted in its 2019 report that "the world’s decision-makers are so consumed with addressing (or failing to address) the daily crises that arise from a world without leadership that they’re allowing a broad array of future risks to germinate, with serious consequences for our collective midterm future." Also on the list were US-Chinese relations, the danger of cyber attacks, European populism, the global innovation winter, and a worldwide coalition of the unwilling.
