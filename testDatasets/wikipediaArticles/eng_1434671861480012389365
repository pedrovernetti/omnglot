## Now Hear This (Hal Galper album)

Now Hear This is an album by American pianist Hal Galper released on the Enja label in 1973.

# Critical reception 

The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden states "Hal Galper has long been an underrated composer and pianist. This Enja release from 1977 finds him at the top of his game in both roles". In 2010 when reviewing the CD reissue he said "This is easily one of Galper's best recordings of the 1970s".
