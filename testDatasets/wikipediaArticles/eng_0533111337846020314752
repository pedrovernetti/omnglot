# Release and reception 

In an AllMusic review, Vincent Jeffries said "This partial assemblage of the classic Cro-Mags lineup features bassist Harley Flanagan and singer John "Bloodclot" Joseph together again after years of separation. The two musicians had last joined forces on the band's seminal hardcore debut, The Age of Quarrel. Dave Holland (guitars), Gabby (guitars), and Dave DiSenso (drums) fill out the lineup for this, the group's third studio recording. With music penned by Flanagan and original guitarist Parris Mayhew, this 1992 release delivers a steady stream of straightforward metal. Alpha-Omega bears only a small resemblance to the frenzied, more destructive style that embodied '80s East Coast hardcore and on which the Cro-Mags' reputation was solidly built. Standout tracks "The Other Side of Madness" and "The Paths of Perfection" have a relatively subdued, melodic texture that furthers the band's career-long gravitation away from its hardcore roots. While certainly a decent offering, this record falls short of it's creators' best work.".
