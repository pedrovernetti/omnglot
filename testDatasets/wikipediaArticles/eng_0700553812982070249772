## Captain Glory

Captain Glory was a character created by Jack Kirby for part of a 12-part series of American comic books published by Topps Comics, with this particular title dated April 1993.
Although Kirby had created this character, it was developed by Roy Thomas and Steve Ditko, who provided story and art.
John Costanza provided lettering with coloring by Janice Parker. The over-all effect was that of an old-fashioned comic in the style popular during the 1960s Silver Age.
The back pages included a reminiscence titled Giants in the Earth by Roy Thomas. Its subjects were Jack Kirby, Don Heck, Dick Ayers, John Severin and Steve Ditko.
An obituary for Harvey Kurtzman written by Jim Salicrup appeared on page 32.
