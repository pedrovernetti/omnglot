# History 

The Institute was established in 1927 with a financial aid from Assamese timber merchant Bholanath Boruah, that was given to British Government in 1922 for establishing a technical school in the name of the 'Prince of Wales' at Jorhat. The institute was founded the following year on 16 January 1928. A four-year certificate course in civil engineering was introduced in 1948. Since 1957, three-year diploma courses have been introduced in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Departments in addition to the Civil Engineering Department. In 1976 & 1978 respectively, courses in automotive and agricultural engineering began. Electronic & telecommunications engineering and instrumentation technology programs were later introduced in 1986.
The Institution was known as the 'War Technical School' during the time of the Second World War.
