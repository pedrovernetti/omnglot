# Public Security Plan and Moralization Campaign 

In 2007, Ahmad-Reza Radan launched a "Public Security Plan". The police arrested dozens of "thugs" to increase public security. The thugs were sometimes beaten on camera in front of neighborhood inhabitants, or forced to wear hanging watering cans used for lavatory ablutions around their necks. Among the arrested people was Meysam Lotfi, a young Iranian who was previously arrested during Iran student riots in July 1999 and jailed for 6 months. According to his parents, he has never had any criminal records or background of illegal action, and has never been arrested or jailed before, omitting the 1999 riots event. He was listed for execution, a sentence that was later changed to a three-year prison sentence after the media coverage and the attempts of his parents as well as human-rights activists. His former lawyer was Abdolfattah Soltani.
