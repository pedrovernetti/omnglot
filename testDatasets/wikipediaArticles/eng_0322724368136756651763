Harry Tracy (23 October 1875-6 August 1902) was an outlaw in the American Old West. His real name was Harry Severns. 
He is said to have run with Butch Cassidy and the Hole in the Wall Gang, and by the time he'd reached adulthood he was actively taking part in acts of robbery and theft. On March 1, 1898, Tracy and three accomplices engaged in a gunfight at Brown's Park, Colorado, in which posseman Valentine S. Hoy was killed. Tracy and an accomplice of the Brown's Creek gunfight were captured but escaped in June 1898 from the Aspen, Colorado, jail. In late 1901, Tracy was captured, convicted, and incarcerated at the Oregon State Penitentiary.

In all the criminal lore of the country there is no record equal to that of Harry Tracy for cold-blooded nerve, desperation and thirst for crime. Jesse James, compared with Tracy, is a Sunday school teacher

With fellow convict David Merrill he escaped on June 9, 1902, shooting and killing corrections officers Thurston Jones Sr., Bailey Tiffany, Frank Ferrell and three civilians in the process. His claim to infamy is the size and scope of the manhunt and the extensive media coverage of same. He evaded capture for a month, mostly taking refuge in the Seattle, Washington, area. On June 28, 1902, an argument broke out between him and Merrill, which ended in a duel. Tracy cheated during their duel and spun around early, and Merill was killed. His body was found on July 14. On July 3, 1902, he set up an ambush near Bothell, Washington, where he killed detective Charles Raymond and deputy John Williams during a shootout. Tracy fled, took several hostages in a residence, and engaged other law enforcement officers in a shootout. During that shootout he killed posse members Cornelious Rowley and Enoch Breece. On August 6, 1902, in Creston, Washington, Tracy was cornered and seriously wounded in the leg during an ambush by a posse from Lincoln County.
